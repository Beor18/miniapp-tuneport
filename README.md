## Problem

- Limited remixes in Web3
- Unfair revenue distribution
- Poorly interactive streaming experience
- Subpar user experience

## Solution

TUNEPORT is a decentralized music platform that puts the artist at the center, enabling a direct-to-fan economy based on music, experiences, and knowledge.

### Built on 4 key principles:

- **Utility**: Features that solve real problems
- **Scalability**: Architecture designed to grow
- **Accessibility**: For both Web2 and Web3 users
- **Passion for music**: Developed by and for music lovers

### Main features:

- Listen to music anywhere, anytime without hassle
- Artists have control over revenue and content
- Interact by creating remixes and tokenizing fragments
- AI agents for music assistance

## Value Proposition

- Comprehensive connection between artists, fans, and record labels
- Elimination of technical barriers for Web2 and Web3 users
- Fair and diversified monetization
- Empowerment of the artist

## Key Innovation

**From NFTs as static products → to NFTs as the result of interaction**

Tuneport turns every second into a collectible experience. Fans select, curate, or remix fragments directly from the stream, generating emotional and traceable value — not through speculation, but through connection.
